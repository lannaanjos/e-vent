## Description
This project is (still) an attempt of making a functional journal system. When I was younger I used to want to journal but I was afraid people could saw my notes. I didn't like journaling on my notes app neither on MS Word nor Google docs because they were too visually pollluted, so i've always wanted to have an application with a simple interface where I could journal when I felt like doing it.\
As I grew up, whenever I reread my notes I would either get frustated because I read one without a date mark so I couldn't know when I wrote it or I cringed and deleted some of them just to get upset for deleting them later. So I came up with the idea of a system which will mark the exact date and time you made a note AND save it permanently.\
obs: you'll still be able to delete your notes but it'll be a hidden feature
