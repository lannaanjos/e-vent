# E-Vent
The e-Vent project is designed to create an anti-manipulation journal system where users cannot delete their entries. This system ensures long-term preservation and data security, being ideal for an unaltered personal history.

This idea came to life thanks to a personal struggle: every time I started a digital journal, I deleted my entries out of embarassement after rereading them. So I realized I could only maintain a consistent journal if I did not have the ability to delete my notes.
